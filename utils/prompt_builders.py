1. Generate risks in DESCENDING ORDER OF IMPORTANCE (most critical â†’ least critical)

3. Consider the REAL-WORLD implications of this specific event
4. Risk #1 = HIGHEST PRIORITY (most likely to cause serious harm/disruption)
5. Risk #2 = SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY, and so on
6. Ensure DIVERSITY across categories: Crowd Safety, Environmental, Security, Medical, Operational, Logistics
7. Impact and likelihood should reflect REALISTIC assessment for this specific event
8. Mitigation strategies must be ACTIONABLE and event-specific

IMPORTANCE RANKING CRITERIA:
- Potential for serious injury/death
- Likelihood of occurrence for THIS event type
- Scale of potential disruption
- Legal/regulatory consequences
- Financial impact
- Reputational damage
